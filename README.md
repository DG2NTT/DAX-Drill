## DAX Drill

This is an Excel XLL add-in for creating custom drill-through action via auto-generated DAX queries to a workbook connection to SQL Server Analysis Services 2016 (tabular mode).

###Roadmap

* This only supports SSAS 2016, not prior versions. We plan to support prior versions.
* Support multiple selections in pivot field (current if you select more than one pivot item in the page field then it will be treated as though you selected all items, i.e. no filter is applied)
