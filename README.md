## DAX Drill

This is an Excel XLL add-in for creating custom drill-through action via auto-generated DAX queries to a workbook connection to SQL Server Analysis Services 2016 running in Tabular mode.

You can view the wiki [here](https://github.com/DG2NTT/DAX-Drill/wiki).

###Roadmap

* Support multiple selections in pivot field (currently if you select more than one pivot item in the page field then it will be treated as though you selected all items, i.e. no filter is applied)
* Create GUI for editing columns displayed in drill-through (currently you need to manually write XML in the built-in XML editor).
